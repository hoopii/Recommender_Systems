## Goal
Create user-based, item-based and model-based movie recommender systems inspired by Netflix recommendations using a dataset of nearly 10.000 movies with more than 100.000 user ratings

## Dataset
- The dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. 
- It contains 100.836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9.742 movies.     
- These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.

- GroupLens, which gathered this data, is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Since its inception in 1992, GroupLens's research projects have explored a variety of fields including:   
  - recommender systems  
  - online communities  
  -  mobile and ubiquitious technologies   
  -  digital libraries    
  -  local geographic information system   
- This and other GroupLens data sets are publicly available for download at http://grouplens.org/datasets/
