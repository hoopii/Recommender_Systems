## Dataset
- The dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. 
- It contains 100.836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9.742 movies.     
- These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.
